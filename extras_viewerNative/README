Minimal OCCT viewer implementation.

It provides functionality:
- Zoom - by right mouse button,
- Pan  - by middle mouse button,
- Rotation - by left mouse button if there is no detection.
- Selection - by left mouse button if detected object exists.
- Selection with rectangle - by left mouse and SHIFT pressed.

The sample imports BRep file if possible, if not it creates default shape (ring).
BRep file name is given as a parameter argument of the sample (on snapshots the 'data\cad\blends\0011_b_boxblend.brep' of AnalysisSitus).
It creates AIS_Trihedron to check the positioning of the shape.
