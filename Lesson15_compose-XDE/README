Lesson 15: Compose XDE.

Special thanks go to Mladen Banovic, my old friend from the IODA project. Mladen had proposed the idea of this lesson.
I use some excerpts from his email explaining the idea below.

This lesson composes an XDE document to export CAD assemblies with names and colors to a STEP file. It is similar to lesson 12,
just the other way around:

1) Create some simple CAD assembly in the XDE document.
2) Put some names on subassemblies and individual parts, apply colors to certain parts.
3) Export to a STEP file.

Having names and colors in a STEP file can be very useful to quickly identify certain parts from the STEP file in
different programs. For example, we could create a geometry in OCCT with this additional information and import it into some CAD
tool like FreeCAD that can also read this information from the STEP. Furthermore, it would also be possible to import
the geometry in some mesh generator that could use names/colors to identify and mesh certain parts with different
conditions automatically.
