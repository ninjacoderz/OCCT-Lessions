Lesson 12: XDE.

This lesson demonstrates how to read and visualize colored shapes and CAD assemblies using the XDE framework of
OpenCascade (http://analysissitus.org/features/features_asm-xde-document.html). The key to efficient visualization
is using the AIS connected interactives that are designed to reproduce the instancing relationships between the assembly
components as they are defined in the input format. The 3D scene leveraging this AIS connected interactives architecture
is populated in `DisplayScene` class.
